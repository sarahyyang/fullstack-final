# COMS 3102 Final Project: Note Taker

This project is created by Sarah Yang as the final project of COMS 3102 Full Stack Web Development.

Note Taker is an application that allows users to take an unlimited number of notes. Because it has both a frontend and a backend, any modifications to existing notes will persist when the page is refreshed. On the application, users can add a new note, delete an existing note, and view all current notes.

It is built using React JS for the frontend, MongoDB database, Axios for communication with the backend, and Node JS/Express for the backend.

## How to Run
In the terminal, run:
```
cd frontend
npm install && npm start
```
Open another terminal, and run:
```
cd backend
npm install && npm start
```
The two terminals must both be running in order for the application to function as expected.

The Note Taker application will now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.
